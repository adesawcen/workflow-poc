# Product Context

## Purpose
The Workflow POC project exists to demonstrate an effective approach to maintaining project knowledge and context across development sessions. It addresses the challenge of context loss that occurs when developers switch between projects or when there are gaps between work sessions.

## Problems Solved
- **Knowledge Continuity**: Prevents loss of context between development sessions
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: Reduces the time needed for new team members to understand the project
- **Decision Tracking**: Maintains a record of why certain technical decisions were made
- **Progress Visibility**: Provides clear visibility into what has been completed and what remains to be done

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear and concise
- **Accessibility**: Information should be easy to find and navigate
- **Completeness**: All relevant project information should be documented
- **Currency**: Documentation should reflect the current state of the project

## Intended Workflow
1. Review memory bank at the start of each session
2. Update documentation as work progresses
3. Document new insights, patterns, and decisions
4. Ensure memory bank is up-to-date before ending a session

## Key Stakeholders
- Developers who need to maintain context between sessions
- Project managers tracking progress
- New team members who need to understand the project quickly
- Future maintainers who need to understand the project's history and design decisions
