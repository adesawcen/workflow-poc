# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Markdown**: Primary format for all documentation files
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes to documentation
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for the repository
- **VSCode**: Recommended editor for working with the documentation

## Development Setup
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/adesawcen/workflow-poc.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd workflow-poc`
- Review the memory bank files in the `memory-bank/` directory
- Use a Markdown editor or viewer to read and update documentation

## Technical Constraints
- Documentation should be in plain text Markdown format for maximum compatibility
- File names should follow the established naming convention
- Updates to the memory bank should be committed along with related code changes
- Memory bank files should be kept concise and focused on their specific purpose

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies required for the documentation system itself
- Markdown viewer or editor for reading and updating documentation
- Git for version control

## Tool Usage Patterns
- **Memory Bank Review**: At the start of each session, review all memory bank files to regain context
- **Documentation Updates**: Update relevant memory bank files as work progresses
- **Commit Practices**: Commit documentation updates along with related code changes
- **Context Switching**: When switching to a different task, update the `activeContext.md` file to reflect the new focus
