# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The Workflow POC project follows a documentation-centric architecture where the memory bank serves as the central knowledge repository. The system is designed around the principle of comprehensive documentation that enables context retention across development sessions.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Markdown-Based Documentation**: Using Markdown for all documentation files for readability and version control compatibility
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organizing documentation in a clear hierarchy with core files and optional context files
- **File-Based System**: Using individual files for different aspects of the project rather than a single monolithic document
- **Version-Controlled Documentation**: Keeping documentation in the same repository as code to ensure synchronization

## Design Patterns
- **Single Source of Truth**: The memory bank serves as the authoritative source for project information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is organized from high-level overview to detailed implementation
- **Living Documentation**: Documentation is continuously updated to reflect the current state of the project
- **Context Preservation**: Explicit documentation of context to prevent knowledge loss

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Creating the core documentation structure
2. **Documentation Updates**: Regular updates to reflect current project state
3. **Context Review**: Reviewing documentation at the start of each session
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Using documentation to onboard new team members
