# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the memory bank structure for the Workflow POC project
- Creating core documentation files to establish project context
- Setting up the foundation for future development work

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank directory structure
- Initialized core documentation files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md (to be created)

## Next Steps
- Complete the memory bank initialization
- Review all documentation for consistency and completeness
- Consider additional context files that might be needed for specific aspects of the project
- Begin implementing project features based on the established documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using a hierarchical documentation structure to organize information logically
- Focusing on clarity and conciseness in documentation
- Ensuring all core files are created before proceeding with implementation
- Establishing patterns for regular documentation updates

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Documentation should be updated as work progresses
- Each file should focus on its specific purpose
- Cross-references between files should be used where appropriate
- Documentation should be reviewed at the start of each session

## Learnings and Project Insights
- A well-structured documentation system is essential for maintaining context
- Clear separation of concerns in documentation makes information easier to find
- Regular updates to documentation prevent knowledge loss
- The memory bank approach addresses the challenge of context switching between sessions
